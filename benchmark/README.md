# Benchmark

## Usage

1. Checkout the source code of the `csv42` project:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/josdejong/csv42.git
   ```
2. Install the dependencies of the `csv42` library itself:
   ```
   npm run install
   ```
3. Move into the directory of the benchmark project:
   ```
   cd ./benchmark
   ```
4. Install the dependencies of the benchmark project once:
   ```
   npm run install
   ```
5. Run the benchmark:
   ```
   npm run benchmark
   ```

## Remarks

1. Doing benchmarks right is hard. Please let me know if you see a flaw in the benchmarks, or if you see ways to configure the libraries better, so we can see them shine.
2. The performance depends of course on what kind of data a single row contains and how much. This benchmark generates test data that contains a bit of everything: string, numbers, strings that need escaping. And in the case of nested data: a nested object and nested array.
3. Support for nested JSON data was an important goal when developing `csv42`. Not all libraries do support flattening nested JSON objects though. This is why the benchmark is tested with two different kinds of data: flat and nested. To make the libraries work with nested data, the data is flattened using the library `flat`. The use of `flat` is denoted with a `(+flat)` suffix in the name of the library. Note that flattening is only applied in the nested JSON benchmarks "nestedToCsv" and "nestedFromCsv", and NOT in the tests "flatToCsv" and "flatFromCsv". From what I've seen, the "flat" step adds something like 20% to the parsing/formatting duration: significant, but not the largest part of the work.
4. The CSV libraries have different defaults when parsing values. Some just leave all values a string, which is fastest. Others parse numeric values into a `number`. In these benchmarks, numeric values are being parsed into numbers, since that is what you mostly need in real-world.

## Conclusion

The `csv42` does no really well. It is faster than the CSV libraries that are popular right now, sometimes by a big margin. It is only outpaced in a few cases where the document is small, and we have a flat JSON document. The libraries `json2csv` and `papaparse` do very well too in many of the tests.

The biggest gaps can be seen when working with nested JSON data. Many libraries do not support flattening nested JSON data, and thus are not designed with this in mind. That may clarify the big differences. Also, some libraries do not support parsing CSV values into numbers for example. My real-world experience is that JSON data models more often than not contain nesting and numeric values, so I think these are essential features to have and test with if you want to mimic real-world situations as well as possible, and offer a batteries included API for a CSV library. But the needs can vary widely of course, hence the large amount of CSV libraries out there, each with a different approach.

## Results
